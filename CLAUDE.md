# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Express Sweet is a full-stack toolkit built on top of Express.js. Auth, ORM, routing, views — everything snaps together so you can ship fast and stay sharp. Built as a TypeScript library that compiles to both ESM and CommonJS formats.

## Build Commands

- **Build**: `npm run build` — Compiles TypeScript source to dist/ (ESM/CJS) and generates types/
- **Clean**: Automatically runs `rm -rf dist types` before build via prebuild script

## Architecture Overview

### Core Mount System
The library uses a centralized mounting system (`src/mount.ts`) that initializes all middleware in a specific order:
1. Global variables setup
2. Environment loading
3. Database models initialization
4. HTTP middleware (body parsing, cookies, static files, logging)
5. View engine (Handlebars)
6. CORS
7. Local variables
8. Authentication (Passport.js)
9. File-based URL routing
10. Error handling

### Key Directories

- **`src/middleware/`** — Express middleware components (auth, cors, error, parser, router, views, etc.)
- **`src/database/`** — Sequelize-based ORM with DatabaseManager singleton and custom Model class
- **`src/helpers/`** — Handlebars template helpers (comparison, date, math, string, etc.)
- **`src/utils/`** — Type checking functions and config loaders
- **`src/types/`** — TypeScript interface definitions
- **`docs/`** — Hand-written reference documentation (configuration, database, authentication, routing, view-engine, file-upload, migration)
- **`examples/`** — Ready-to-use config templates (ESM and CJS)
- **`demo/`** — Full-featured demo app (ESM and CJS versions) with auth, CRUD, file uploads, and error pages

### Configuration System
The library expects configuration files in a consuming application's `config/` directory:
- `config/config.js` — App basics (CORS, body size, routing, error handling)
- `config/database.js` — Sequelize connection settings (environment-based)
- `config/authentication.js` — Passport.js auth settings
- `config/view.js` — Handlebars view engine settings
- `config/logging.js` — Morgan HTTP request logging
- `config/upload.js` — Multer file upload configuration

### Database Layer
- `DatabaseManager` singleton manages a single Sequelize instance across all models
- 5 public methods: `getInstance()`, `isConnected()`, `getConfig()`, `getSequelizeOptions()`, `close()`
- Custom `Model` class with `findById()`, `begin()`, `query()`, `association()`, and Sequelize utilities (`Op`, `fn`, `col`, `literal`, `where`, `DataTypes`, `QueryTypes`, `Transaction`)
- Automatic model loading from `models/` directory
- All models share the same connection pool

### Authentication System
- Passport.js local strategy with username/password
- Session management with Redis or memory store
- 4 static methods on `Authentication` class: `authenticate()`, `logout()`, `successRedirect()`, `failureRedirect()`
- Automatic route protection with `allow_unauthenticated` patterns
- AJAX requests get 401, HTML requests get redirected

### View Engine
- Handlebars via express-handlebars with 37 built-in helpers across 9 categories
- `beforeRender` hook for setting view-wide local variables
- `block`/`contentFor` helpers for layout content injection

## TypeScript Configuration

Uses path mapping with `~/*` alias pointing to `src/*` for clean imports. Targets ESNEXT with strict type checking enabled.

## Build System

Rollup-based build with:
- TypeScript compilation via rollup-plugin-typescript2
- Terser minification
- CommonJS (.cjs) and ESM (.mjs) dual output
- Node.js built-ins and all dependencies automatically externalized
- Type declaration generation to types/

## Development Notes

- The library is designed to be consumed, not developed as a standalone application
- No test scripts are configured — testing happens in consuming applications
- Uses semantic versioning with comprehensive changelog
- MIT licensed
- User prefers Japanese communication
- Documentation lives in hand-written markdown (README + docs/), not TypeDoc
